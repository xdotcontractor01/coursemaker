A cross section shows \nwhat the road would look like if you cut it from side to side.\n\nAs you can see in Figure 3-1 on screen, this shows an idealized roadway typical section \nwith the various elements identified. The left side of the typical section illustrates \nhow the roadway is to be constructed in a fill area, where earth has been added \nto raise the road above the existing ground level.\n\nThe right side of this typical section illustrates how the roadway is to be constructed \nin a cut area, where the road will be below the existing grade, meaning earth \nhas been removed to lower the road surface.\n\nIt's important to note that the right and left sides of the typical section \nare interchangeable\u2014they simply show different construction conditions that \nmay occur along the length of the project.\n\nLooking at the typical section, you can identify key features such as travel lanes, \nshoulders, medians, ditches, and slopes. All of these elements are shown with \ntheir exact dimensions, allowing contractors to construct the roadway precisely \nas designed.",

This detail shows the exact composition \nand thickness of each pavement layer.\n\nThe typical section will specify the types of materials to be used, such as \nasphaltic concrete, aggregate base course, and subgrade preparation. \nEach layer is shown with its required thickness, ensuring the roadway \nis built to the proper specifications.\n\nThese pavement details are critical because they determine the structural integrity \nand longevity of the roadway. Contractors must follow these specifications exactly \nas shown on the typical section to ensure the finished road meets the design requirements \nand will perform as intended under traffic loads.\n\nThe paving schedule may vary for different sections of the roadway, such as \ntangent sections versus curved sections, so it's important to check the typical section \nthat applies to the specific location you're working on.",

      "narration_text": "An important concept to understand about typical sections \nis that the dimensions given are horizontal dimensions.\n\nThis means that the distances are not measured along the slopes of the roadway. \nFor example, if the typical section shows that the distance from the profile grade \nof the left lane to the edge of the pavement is written as 24 feet, that is a horizontal distance.\n\nHowever, if you were to measure along the one-quarter inch per foot slope of the pavement, \nthat distance would actually be slightly longer than 24 feet. Figure 3-3 on screen \nexaggerates this difference to help you understand the distinction.\n\nAll dimensions shown by level lines on typical sections are horizontal distances. \nThis is an important distinction because when contractors are staking out the roadway \nor placing materials, they need to understand that these dimensions are measured horizontally, \nnot along any sloped surfaces.\n\nThis horizontal measurement system is used consistently throughout highway construction plans \nbecause it provides a standardized way to show dimensions that can be accurately measured \nin the field using standard surveying equipment. Explanations of slopes and their relationship \nto horizontal distances will be discussed in more detail later in this manual.",
