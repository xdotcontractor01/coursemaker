It helps you quickly orient yourself to where the construction will take place. You'll see major roads, county boundaries, and other landmarks that provide geographic context.\n\nThink of it as answering the question: Where exactly is this project located?",

Imagine you're flying over the construction site in an airplane, looking straight down. That's what the Layout View represents.\n\nThis view displays the beginning station and ending station of the project. As highlighted on screen, these stations mark the start and end points of the roadway construction. Understanding stations is essential for locating specific points along the project.",
