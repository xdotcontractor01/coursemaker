These include the Specifications, Supplemental Specifications, Plans, Special Provisions, and all supplementary documents.\n\nHere's the key point: a requirement occurring in any one of these parts is just as binding as if it appeared in all of them. This means you must carefully review every component of the contract, not just the plans themselves.",

The Georgia DOT has established a clear hierarchy to resolve such conflicts.\n\nAs you can see on screen, the governing order is as follows: First, Special Provisions take precedence over everything else. Second come Project Plans, including Special Plan Details. Third are Supplemental Specifications. Fourth are Standard Plans and Standard Construction Details. And fifth, at the lowest priority, are Standard Specifications.\n\nAdditionally, calculated dimensions will always govern over scaled dimensions. This hierarchy ensures that the most project-specific information takes precedence.",

The Engineer will then make the necessary corrections and interpretations to fulfill the intent of the Plans or Specifications.\n\nThis rule protects the integrity of the project and ensures that construction proceeds according to the original design intent, even when documentation contains mistakes.",

While this order may vary slightly for individual projects, the general sequence is consistent.\n\nAs shown on screen, the typical order begins with the Cover Sheet, followed by the Index, Revision Summary Sheet, and General Notes. Next come Typical Sections, Summary of Quantities, and various plan drawings. The sequence continues through Drainage, Cross Sections, Utility Plans, and specialized drawings like Lighting, Signing, and Bridge Plans.\n\nUnderstanding this standard arrangement helps you quickly locate the information you need within a plan set.",
