# Forward

This Plan Reading Course is to present a step-by-step procedure on how to read, interpret, and relate to a standard set of roadway plans; to help identify and interpret symbols used in a standard set of plans; and to help develop the necessary skills to interpret a set of plans in non-technical terms to laypersons (property owners and others). Along with this manual you will use plan sheets and standards that specifically relate to a project. The plan sheets/ standards included have been reduced to half their original size so they can be handled more easily.

A partnership of Transportation entities, The Georgia Partnership for Transportation Quality (GPTQ), works together to improve the quality of the nation's highways and as one of the initiatives, the GPTQ Steering Committee created a team from public and private sector organizations to jointly focus on the improvement of highway construction plans. The team determined that quality improvements were attainable by developing a Plan Presentation Guide to assist designers in the presentation of the work to be accomplished and thereby making plans more efficient for the user. This guide can be found on the Georgia DOT Web Pages for further information.

Since it is our intent to provide you, the student, with a "well rounded" exposure to highway construction plans, you may be asked to look at a plan sheet from a particular project. Please be sure that you are looking at the correct set of plans for the text that you are reading and the questions you may be asked to answer.

# A Note on Safety

As an employee of the Georgia Department of Transportation, it is your responsibility to direct your concern to one goal, which is to provide the traveling public with the best and safest roadway system that can be constructed.

With this goal constantly in mind, it is the responsibility of each DOT employee to observe, suggest, and act to achieve a safe system of roadways throughout the State. Regardless of a specific assigned duty, it is the responsibility of all the employees of the Georgia Department of Transportation to call to his/her supervisor's attention any item, whether in design or construction, which appears to be an obvious hazard to the motoring public.

Safety is our business and will remain the primary factor in designing and constructing highways.

# Nuts and Bolts of the Course

This is a self-instructional study course. The subject matter is arranged so that you the student may work at your own speed. Each part of the course builds on the information that has preceded it and prepares for information to follow. Most of the parts present new information. Some parts review important concepts that have been introduced to you earlier in the program and apply these concepts in new ways.

The idea behind this method is for you to read and study the information, actively participate by writing or checking off answers to questions, then find out immediately if you are correct. This method reinforces what you have read and enables you to retain what you have learned for a longer period of time. The retention of information from a self-instructional study course should be far greater than from a lecture or textbook.

To get the most from this course, start at the beginning. Read each section as it comes; preparing you for the next section. You will find questions within each section. By answering these questions, you will be able to retain what you have just read longer than by lecture or discussion.

The answers to these questions appear at the end of the text.

# Chapter 1: Beginning to Read Plans

# GENERAL INFORMATION

# REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS

A requirement occurring in one of the parts of a Georgia DOT contract is as binding as though occurring in all. The Specifications, Supplemental Specifications, Plans, Special Provisions, and all supplementary documents are all part of the contract.

# WHAT PART OF THE CONTRACT APPLIES?

In case of a discrepancy, certain parts of the contract govern over others. The governing order will be as follows:

1. Special Provisions  
2. Project Plans including Special Plan Details  
3. Supplemental Specifications  
4. Standard Plans including Standard Construction Details  
5. Standard Specifications

Calculated dimensions will govern over scaled dimensions.

The Contractor shall take no advantage of any apparent error or omissions in the Plans or Specifications. In the event the Contractor discovers such an error or omission, he shall immediately notify the Engineer. The Engineer will then make such corrections and interpretations as may be deemed necessary for fulfilling the intent of the Plans or Specifications.

# DESCRIPTION

Looking at your set of plans you should have found this description.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/58966cfcfe9fd560a7a2c4cfc8772c8239f36114ab22e616e7797f8de01c9cf4.jpg)  
Figure 1-2. Description of Project.

You will note that the proposed project is for construction of SR 16 in Spalding and Butts Counties.

The next thing to be noted is the Project Identification Number (P.I. No.) The project Program Identification Number is 332520.

This project also has a second P.I. No. (0000523) for the interstate bridge widening project. Not all projects will have multiple PIs. This plan set only covers P.I. No. 332520.

The project number for P.I. No. 332520 is STP-IM-022-1(26) and the project number for P.I. No. 0000523 is IM-0000-001 (523). Questions in this text only refer to P.I. No. 332520 which is project number STP-IM-022-1(26).

Lastly, note that this project has does not have a Federal Route Number, only a State Route Number of 16.

# PROJECT LOCATION SKETCH

In the upper left corner of the Cover Sheet is a Location Sketch, which shows the general geographical area of the project. This map shows the approximate limits of the project. An example is shown at the right in Figure 1-3.

# SCALE

Roadway and structure plans are drawn to scale in order that they might be presented on easy-to-use sheets.

Roadway plans are normally drawn with an engineer's scale while structure plans use both engineer's and architect's scales.

A civil engineer's scale has divisions of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 to the inch.

An architect's (or mechanical engineer's) scale expresses scale as fraction of an inch to one foot. Sample scales would be  $\frac{1}{4} =$  one foot,  $\frac{3}{8} = 1$  foot,  $\frac{1}{8} = 1$  foot, or similar.

The engineer's scale is one that expresses "scale" as 1 inch = 10 feet; 1 inch = 20 feet, 1 inch = 30 feet, 1 inch = 40 feet, 1 inch = 50 feet, 1 inch = 60 feet, or some multiple of these numbers. It is usually 1 foot long and may be triangular or flat.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/25aa20b11bc17322942fbc4764af7c95258df8b9344efb9fe6dabc401aa15195.jpg)  
Figure 1-9. Civil engineer's scale (above top) and architect's scale (above bottom).

The scales are divided into decimal parts of an inch such as 1/10th inch, 1/20th inch, etc.

The triangular, or six-scale scale, has scales with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 divisions to the inch. In the next drawing, each division equals 1-foot - in the  $1'' = 10'$  scale, there are 10 divisions to the inch. Each division can be treated in multiples of 10 as well, for example,  $1'' = 100'$ ,  $1'' = 1000'$ , etc.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/a76db50d8c607aa0d9ea60c66f0dc3f1c971e837b6d2559b99083f4b3a0fc7c9.jpg)  
Figure 1-10. Detail of the Engineer's Scale.

The scale on which the Cover Sheet was plotted is shown graphically above the Length of Project Box. The cover sheet for this plan set is  $1" = 2000'$ . Plan sheets, however, are plotted on various scales depending on the need for detail, etc., and are notated as such on the respective plan sheets. Turn to Sheet No. 60 and note the scale. A bar scale is shown and stated in feet.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/2135d6be8ed6c64c473b2d046c198d4a3bcd7ba83eec233eb614fa67706efa69.jpg)

# Chapter 2: Index and Revision Summary Sheet

# INDEX

An index is required for each set of construction plans to help the user in identifying what sheets are in the set of plans. The index can be included on the cover sheet on smaller projects with few sheets, but normally it will be included as a separate sheet directly following the coversheet.

The index sheet includes a description of each plan sheet with each corresponding sheet number. A listing of all the Georgia DOT standards and construction drawings relating to that particular project, are also shown along with the corresponding standard number, the most recent revision date of the standard, and the sheet number.

An area is usually available on the sheet for later additions or deletions of sheets and the total number of all sheets are shown.

# REVISION SUMMARY SHEET

At times after the final set of plans have been drawn up, it will be necessary to revise (change) the design for a portion of the plans. A Revision Summary Sheet is used for the purpose of keeping a record of those revisions. For this reason, a revision summary sheet is a required element of a set of construction plans.

Figure 2-1. Index Sheet.

The Revision Summary Sheet consists of three columns (in addition to the normal project information in the title blocks). The first column is for the date on which the revision was made; the second column is for the plan sheet number; and the third column contains a description of the revision, described in enough detail to quickly understand the nature of the revision. The Revision Summary Sheet will typically follow directly behind the Index Sheet or the Cover Sheet.

# Chapter 3:Typical Sections

# INTRODUCTION TO TYPICAL SECTIONS

The typical section is a picture, with dimensions, of how the cross-sectional view of the roadway would appear after the construction is completed. A cross section is how the view of the road would look if cut from side to side. Figure 3-1 shows an idealized roadway typical section with the various elements identified.

The left side of Figure 3-1 below illustrates how the roadway is to be constructed in a fill area. The right side of this typical section illustrates how the roadway is to be constructed in a cut area (the road will be below existing grade). We will talk in more detail about "cut" and "fill" later. However, the right and left sides of the Typical Section are interchangeable.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/d2f5015ff5d016767e8142ab58273f4eb07a7e90241def8ec723c631d5000ff0.jpg)  
Figure 3-1. Typical Roadway Section.

Look at Construction Plan Sheet #7 and find some of the significant features you should know about this Typical Section:

1. This is a dual-lane roadway with a median.  
2. The travel lanes for each side of the roadway are 24 ft. wide.  
3. There is a 6'6" paved shoulder on the outside of each roadway and a two foot paved shoulder on the inside (median) side of each roadway.  
4. The profile grade point is at the construction centerline (  $C_L$  CONST).  
5. The location where the typical section is to be used is shown.  
6. Paving requirements are also spelled out under the Normal Tangent Section. Refer to Figure 3-2 on the following page for a detail of "REQUIRED PAVEMENT" from Sheet 7.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/19c7a5d605babe0b6b5b50cc0cb246a03f4c04fcffc1921a77d3facbbe8e94ba.jpg)  
Figure 3-2. Required Pavement

# HORIZONTAL DISTANCE

The dimensions given for Typical Sections are Horizontal dimensions. This means that the distances are not measured along the slopes of the roadway. For example, the distance from the profile grade of the left lane of the Typical Section to the edge of the pavement is written as  $24'$ . The distance measured along the  $1/4$  per foot slope would be slightly longer than  $24'$ . Figure 3-3 exaggerates that difference. All the dimensions shown by level lines are Horizontal Distances. Explanations of Slopes will be discussed later in this book.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/cd36c52ffd8f1f36b66985cd1c5962a6554d4cdb0e552d001e858ef16022559a.jpg)  
Figure 3-3. Horizontal Distance compared with Slope Distance.

Use Construction Plan Sheet 7, Tangent Section (Section 3), and answer these questions:

3-1 What is the total thickness of the Asphaltic Concrete?  
3-2 What is the material used under the Asphaltic Concrete?  
3-3 How wide is the outside unpaved shoulder?  
3-4 What is the slope required on the outside paved shoulder?  
3-5 How many lanes make up the normal section for each side of this roadway?  
3-6 How wide is the median ditch?

# Chapter 4: Summary & Detailed Estimate Quantities

# SUMMARY OF QUANTITIES

The Summary of Quantities Construction Plan Sheets show all the items of construction that are indicated on the Plan and Profile Sheets. The items are normally lumped together into like categories and then the categories are placed in boxes on the sheet with their representative quantities. An exception to this is if it's stated that an item is included in the cost of another item. Another exception would be on a small bridge replacement project where quantities are small and pay items are very limited. In this case, the quantities are placed on the Detailed Estimate only.

Turn to the Summary of Quantities for Sheets 12 through 19. The Summary of Quantity notes the location, size, etc., where the item is required.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/4d6c1acad8f6624f1cbd8509f5105ae839a502fa17074fa388a39d3152885598.jpg)  
Figure 4-1. Summary of Quantities.

Using Construction Plan Sheets number 18-30, answer these questions:

4-1 How many tons of aggregate surface course is required?  
4-2 How many total linear feet of woven wire field fence is needed?  
4-3 Between Sta.  $153 + 00$  and  $159 + 25$ , how many feet of guard rail are required?  
4-4 How much concrete and steel reinforcing bar are required at structure 23, Sta.  $233 + 20?$

# DRAINAGE SUMMARY

A numerical drainage summary is used in most project plans. This part of the summary is usually on its own sheet in a set of Plans and follows after the Summary of Quantities Plan Sheet. Storm drain pipe, drainage structures, culverts, etc., that are to be placed on the project are listed in a chart format with the quantities needed and then consecutively numbered. The numbers correspond with the numbers on the Plan View Plan Sheets and the Drainage Cross Section sheets so that project personnel are able to cross-reference them from one view to another. Sheet 30 provides an example of drainage quantities, and box culvert information is found on Sheet 21.

# DETAILED ESTIMATE

If included in your plan set, the Detailed Estimate lists the required pay item numbers and the quantity for each item. The Office of Contracts Administration also uses this sheet in preparing the bid proposal.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/8319fed7bf31a55061ad5c5f3d5c760ac89f03d3ffa9cafdc00def8291d436b4.jpg)  
Figure 4-2. Drainage Summary, Sheet 30.

Remember that these quantities are estimates: the contractor will be paid for the actual quantities used in the project construction. If there are any items in the contract that are not to be paid for the Department usually lists them in a separate column labeled "Non-Participatory Items". The Detailed Estimate plan sheet is listed in numerical order by the item number.

The pay item number, description, and units are shown verbatim from the Department's "Pay Item Index". Quantities are usually shown in whole units and rounded up unless it is measured "per each."

# Chapter 5:Views

# INTRODUCTION TO VIEWS

Before going any further, you need to know more about the different viewing angles from which various things are shown in a set of plans. A view is the way you look at or "see" the different items that are shown on a set of plans.

A view may show something observed from the inside or from the outside. These views are drawn to give you clear and complete pictures of how the fence, pipe, ditch, or culvert, etc., should be built or placed. To get the information you need, you must be able to look at the view and "see" what is being pictured. You need to know from which angle the item is shown. To help you "see" the different views, a chair will be used as the object pictured because of its familiarity to the reader.

The views here show this chair in the same way that the "real" views show things more appropriate to road and structure building.

Figure 5-1. Plan View

A Plan View is a view from directly above the object. A top view looking down on a chair is pictured. Dotted lines show parts of the chair you would not see because the seat would hide the legs and crosspieces and you would not see them.

Now look at the set of plans you were given with this material. The first sheet, cover sheet, shows a Plan View of the entire project. If you were flying in an airplane over this project and looked down, the plan view is what you would see.

The next set of views shows the elevation or height of the chair from the side and rear. The view might also be shown from the other side or from the front.

# LONGITUDINAL CROSS SECTION

As you face the side of the chair, a section has been "sliced" away. You see the inside of the seat from the side. Also note the inside of the crosspieces at the top and bottom of the chair.

Figure 5-3. Longitudinal Cross Section (Left), Standard Cross Section (Right).

# CROSS SECTION

As you face the front of the chair, a section has been "sliced" away. Here the chair was sliced across the seat. You see the layers of the cushion and seat inside the seat. The rest of the chair, shown by dotted lines, is behind the point where the "slice" was made.

# PROFILE VIEW

A Profile View is a lot like a longitudinal cross section of the roadway. Rather than left to right, the profile view shows the "hills and valleys" of the roadway running along the centerline of the road. It is how the road would look if you were actually riding on the surface of the road. (Profile view will be further discussed in another chapter, where you will see example images using the profile view.)

5-1 Below is a drawing of an old boat. Five of the six views mentioned previously are shown on it. Write the name of the view above each drawing.

If you missed any of the names of the views, be sure you correct them. Make sure that you understand your corrections. When you are reading plans, you will not be required to name the views. However, you should know what the names mean so that when looking at a plan, you will know whether you are seeing the item from the rear (rear elevation), from the inside (cross-section), etc. This will help you "see" the item better.

Of course, the actual views on a set of plans also give dimensions, materials used in construction, and many other construction details.

The ELEVATIONS generally show the items from the OUTSIDE. These views are usually very clear drawings, almost like a picture.

The CROSS-SECTIONS always show an inside view - something has been "sliced" away to show you how the inside part should be. These slices may be made at any point and would be compared to cutting an apple into two parts with a knife. The next pages show you how you can sometimes tell where the section is or where the "cut" was made.

Suppose, for example, sections of a pencil were used to show the inside materials at different places along the length. See how this is shown in Figure 5-5. The lines between the letters A-A, B-B, and C-C show where the section is taken. These arrows on the ends of the lines show which way you're looking toward when you look at the section.

Using the drawing of the pencil Figure 5-6, answer the questions:

5-2 Consider the eraser end the "back" of the pencil and the pointed end the "front". Is section A-A looking toward the back or the front of the pencil?  
5-3 What direction are you looking toward in Section B-B?

# Chapter 6: Stationing, Symbols and Abbreviations

# STATIONING

Stationing is fundamental to highway plans. A station is the horizontal measurement along the Construction Survey Line of a project. Distances are measured and points are identified on plans with reference to station numbers. One hundred feet is equivalent to one station. Highway stationing might be compared with a rope having knots at 100-foot intervals. The beginning end of the rope would be 0, the first knot at 100 feet would be Station Number 1 and would be written as  $1 + 00$ . The second station number would be 2 (which is 200 feet from the beginning) and would be written as  $2 + 00$ , and so on.

Station numbers usually increase from the beginning of the project to the end of the project with the convention of South to North or from West to East. The beginning station of a project can be assumed or referenced to a previous project. If assumed, it generally starts with  $10 + 00$  or  $100 + 00$ . If there was a project for this road in the past, the beginning station number may be much higher than the previous example.

Two types of centerline are used. A survey centerline is used to denote the existing alignment, and a construction

centerline is used to denote the proposed alignment. In this text, a reference to centerline generally indicates construction line unless the survey centerline is shown and specifically referenced.

The length of the project in feet may be arrived at by subtracting the beginning station from the ending station and multiplying by one hundred.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/9b1384908def509d8799766b63f4cced0fe0e05b8fde1b065795f76025b2832c.jpg)  
Figure 6.1 How to Think about Stations.

For instance, if a project begins at station 650 (written  $650 + 00$ ) and ends at station 920 (written  $920 + 00$ ), the

length is (920-650) X  $100 = 27,000$  feet. This can easily be converted to miles by dividing by 5280 feet per mile.

Think of stations in this way (refer to Figure 6.1).

Just as 12 inches make one foot, 100 feet make one station. It is 100 feet from Station  $1 + 00$  to Station  $2 + 00$  or Sta. 493 to Sta. 494, etc.

Answer the question:

6-1 How many feet make up a station?

# HALF STATIONS

A half station is 50 feet and is located halfway between stations. It is written as  $+50$  after the station number.

Figure 6-2 shows you how station numbers and half stations are written. Any point between two stations is shown in this same manner.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/1750064456d0367ae56d2265d012bd48cd7201778d8961c68fe617551931c648.jpg)  
Figure 6-2. Stationing Example Illustrating Halfway.

For example, two feet forward of station  $500 + 00$  is written as  $500 + 02$ . Numbers less than 10 are indicated as 01, 02, 03, etc. Ninety nine feet ahead of station  $500 + 00$  is written as  $500 + 99$ . Of course, 100 feet ahead of STA.  $500 + 00$  is STA.  $501 + 00$ .

In other words, to show that a point is exactly on a station write it as  $+00$ .

To find the distance between any two stations (Except where station equations or equalities are involved) simply subtract the lower station from the higher one, ignoring the plus sign. You will get the answer in feet.

Example

To find the distance from Station 20+60 to Station 2060

12+80, you can write the numbers without the + sign like - 1280

this: 780

It is 780 feet from Station 20+60 to Station 12+80.

To check:

From Station 12+80 to 13+00 20

From 13+00 to 20+00 (7 stations) 700

From 20+00 to 20+60 +60

780

Please calculate the following:

6-2 The distance from Station  $14 + 10$  to  $15 + 00$  is ______ feet  
6-3 The distance from Station  $80 + 10$  to  $85 + 20$  is feet  
6-4 The distance between Station 48+76.2 and Station 51+24.8 is ______ feet.

On the Plan Sheets, the Station Numbers are usually written along the Construction Centerline. Stationing is sometimes along a baseline, or along one lane of a multiple lane highway. On a project, AHEAD means in the direction in which Station Numbers increase (usually toward the END of a project) BACK means in the direction in which Station Numbers decrease (usually towards the BEGINNING of the project).

Ahead is sometimes abbreviated FWD (for FORWARD), and BACK is abbreviated BK.

On a plan sheet, stationing would be similar to that shown above on Figure 6-3

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/4bf6852054b304a332f00b35d495e25a671c28f08f6179564db0d38493f3d541.jpg)  
Figure 6-3. Plan Sheet Stationing.

Please answer the following questions based on this figure:

6-5 How far is it from Station  $410 + 00$  to Station  $411 + 00?$  feet  
6-6 How far is it from Station  $409 + 00$  to Station  $409 + 69?$  feet  
6-7 How far is it from Station  $410 + 30.17$  to Station  $412 + 89.29?$  feet  
6-8 What is the Station Number of a point on Survey C/L 50 feet AHEAD of Station  $412 + 00?$  
6-9 What is the Station Number of a point 50 feet BACK of Station  $412 + 00?$  
6-10 What is the distance between Station 411+50 and Station 412+50? feet

Generally, station numbers progress (increase) from WEST to EAST or from SOUTH to NORTH. Since highways curve and change direction, the above statement is not always true on any one segment of the road.

Just remember that when you say AHEAD you mean toward a higher or "up" station. When you say BACK, you mean toward a lower or "down" station.

# STATION EQUATIONS (EQUALITIES)

Sometimes it is necessary to relate a system of stationing to another system as the connection between two projects or to account for an increase or decrease in the project's length due to a change in horizontal alignment.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/0a98b8d799a499aff1ae62080bbe836ad2f0200432326288999b18a59b439bb7.jpg)  
Figure 6-4. Station Equality.

Equalities are written to describe a point on a Construction  $\mathbf{G}_{\mathrm{L}}$  where the station numbers of one system change to the station numbers of another system.

Here is one equality:

Station  $138 + 49.42$  BACK = Station  $114 + 11.00$  AHEAD as shown in Figure 6-4.

The first number is the stationing that is ending. The next number is the beginning station number.

Please answer the following questions:

6-11 If you are walking along the reading the station numbers written on the stakes and these numbers are getting larger as you go, there is a good chance that you are walking toward what direction?

6-12 If this station equation is given:

$$
\text {S t a t i o n} 5 5 0 + 0 0 \mathrm {B A C K} = 2 + 0 0 \mathrm {A H E A D}
$$

a. What is the Station Number of a point 50 feet BACK of the equation?  
b. What is the Station Number of a point 50 feet AHEAD of the equation?

Any point pertaining to a project may be located on the ground and on the plans by its Station and the number of feet LT/RT (LEFT or RIGHT) of the Construction  $G_{L}$  (centerline). Left and Right of the Construction Line  $G_{L}$  is orientated to increasing stationing (facing ahead). Note that Left and Right are often abbreviated as LT and RT.

6-15 Station numbers generally increase toward the or  
6-16 How far (in feet) is Sta.  $15 + 88.60$  from Sta.  $15 + 00?$  
6-17 Is Sta.  $13 + 00$  ahead of or back of Sta.  $14 + 00?$  
6-18 How far is it from Sta.  $13 + 50$  to Sta.  $16 + 00?$  
6-19 What station is 100 ft. AHEAD of Sta.  $1142 + 40\mathrm{BK} = \mathrm{STA}$  .  $1 + 00$  AHD(AHEAD)?  
6-20 What station is 100 ft. BACK of a point at which the equation in question number 6-19 is given?

# DETERMINING OF THE PROJECT LENGTH

If there are NO STATION EQUALITIES on the project, you can subtract the beginning station from the ending station and have the length of the project.

This project ends at station

701+50.00

This project begins at station

409+69.00

Equals the length of the project

291+81.00

Always remember that this length,  $291 + 81.00$  (or  $291 + 80 \times 100$  ft/station) is the length of the project only if no equalities occur between the beginning and the end of the project. To determine the mileage in a project, you divide the feet in the project by 5280 ft. (the number of feet in a mile). In this case you would divide 29,181.00 by 5280 and you would get 5.526 miles.

# INTRODUCTION TO SYMBOLS

A legend of symbols and abbreviations is not included in the plans. However, certain symbols and abbreviations are common to a set of highway plans. For example, see Figure 6-6.

# Introduction to Plan Abbreviations

It is often necessary to abbreviate words on plan sheets. Some standard abbreviations are:

Ahd/FWD = Ahead

$\mathrm{Beg} = \mathrm{Begin}$

Emb = Embankment

Hwy = Highway

Pd = Pond

$\mathrm{R} / \mathrm{W} =$  Right-of-Way

# Chapter 7: Plan and Profile Sheets

# Introduction to Plan and Profile Sheets

Roadway Plan Sheets depict details of the project's horizontal alignment. They may be presented in conjunction with the corresponding profile on the lower half of the sheet called a Plan/Profile Sheet, or the Profile Plan Sheets will be a separate sheet from the Plan Sheet.

Existing features and roadway design elements such as pavement and shoulder widths, medians, curbs, drainage elements, tapers, turning provisions, and intersecting roadways are shown on these sheets. All horizontal geometry is depicted and labeled to fully define the design intent. Separate Plan Sheets may be required for details, which cannot be adequately shown on the Roadway Plan Sheets.

Both separate Plan & Profile Sheets and combinations Plan/Profile Sheets give a view of the entire project. They both begin with the lowest station number and the beginning of the project and show the entire roadway ahead to the end of the project.

# PLAN VIEW

Remember that a PLAN VIEW shows the roadway as if you were flying over the project and were looking down. Turn to Construction Plan Sheet 60. On this Plan Sheet, the PAVEMENT LINES (edges of the pavement) are shown.

You can also see the SURVEY LINE running from the left of the sheet "AHEAD" to the right of the sheet, then continuing on the Construction Plan Sheet 61. Above Construction  $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{L}}$ , on the Plan Sheet, is considered left of the Survey Line.

Below the survey  $C_L$  is considered right of the Survey Line. Either case will be as though you were standing on the Survey Line facing ahead.

Remember throughout this course and when speaking of plans that LEFT refers to LEFT of the Construction Line  $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{L}}$  and RIGHT refers to the Right of the Construction Line  $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{L}}$ , relative to increasing stationing as, shown in the previous drawing, not the left and right side of the Plan Sheet.

Figure 7-1. Plan View of a Roadway.

On all construction plans and right of way plans, there is an arrow-like symbol with the point indicating North. The north arrow will be orientated on the plans to north (not necessarily to the top of the page) and will indicate the basis of north. Figure 7.2 shows a north arrow referenced to magnetic north and one referenced to the Georgia

Figure 7-2. North-South Arrow.

State Plane Coordinate System West Zone.

The direction of all control and boundary lines is in reference to this North arrow.

The direction of a Construction Line as you are advancing in stationing, as expressed by a bearing, defines the relationship between the direction of the survey line and a North line. It is customary to orient drawings so that the North direction is to the TOP of the plan. However, since plans for a complete highway project can seldom be confined to a single sheet, and must be a series of sheets, it is an accepted practice to make the plans so as to extend from left to right without regard to the North direction. Look again at Construction Plan Sheet 61 and see the NORTH ARROW at the top right corner of the sheet. Remember that Station Numbers usually increase from SOUTH to NORTH.

Circle the correct answer:

7-1 There is an arrow-like symbol with the point indicating (north / south) on all construction plans.  
7-2 (Roadway Plan Sheets / Drainage Cross Section Sheets) depict details of the project's horizontal alignment.  
7-3 Below the Centerline is considered (left / right) of the survey line.

# HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT

Horizontal Alignment consists of tangents (straight sections of road) and curves and is shown on the Plan View. Plan views are shown on the construction and right of way plan sheets. Construction Plan Sheet 60 shows the Horizontal Alignment. Construction Plan Sheet 106 shows the Vertical Alignment or Profile View of the same section of roadway. (Vertical Alignment will be discussed more later).

- Point on Curve: A point on a curved segment of roadway  
- Superelevation: Elevating the outside edge of pavement; this compensates for centrifugal force in a curved segment of roadway.  
- Delta Angle: The angle that intersects between the forward and back angle.  
- Superelevation Rate: Percent slope required on a pavement surface in a curve segment of roadway  
- Superelevation Runoff: The distance of the transition area where the road goes from a normal crown to full superelevation.  
- Tangent Distance: The distance measured from the P.C. (point of curve) or P.T. (point of tangent) to the P.I. (point of intersection)  
Length of Curve: The distance measured along the curve from the P.C. (point of curve) to P.T. (point of tangent)  
- Degree of Curve: Angle to express how quickly a curve turns.  
Tangent: A straight segment of roadway  
- Point of intersection: The point where 2 tangents intersect  
- Curve: Segment of roadway joining two tangent segments  
- Point of curvature: Beginning of a horizontal curve  
- Point of Tangent: The end of a curve.

True or False

7-4 True False A tangent is an arc or segment of a circle joining two lines.  
7-5 True False A circular curve is an arc or segment of a circle joining two tangents.

Superelevation Rate (the amount the road needs to be elevated on the surface of a curve in order to overcome the centrifugal force that acts on a motor vehicle.)

Turn to Construction Plan Sheet 60 and answer the questions:

7-6 At what station does the project begin?  
7-7 What do we call the sheets that give horizontal alignmentinformation?

Turn to Construction Plan Sheets 60 and 61 and answer the questions:

7-8 What is the station number of the P.C. for curve 42?  
7-9 What is the degree of curve for this curve?

SPIRAL CURVES (Transition Curves) are introduced for the purpose of connecting a tangent with a circular curve in such a manner that the change of direction and elevation from one to the other takes place gradually. A spiral is a curve in which the degree of curve increases directly with the length of curve measured from the point where the curve leaves the tangent. The degree of curve is zero at the tangent and at the point at which the spiral meets the circular, it is equal to the degree of circular curve.

Spiral curves are always used in railroad work, but are seldom used in new construction highway work.

Figure 7-4 shows the following significant spiral curve stations.

TS—Tangent to spiral station

SC—Spiral to curve station

CS—Curve to spiral station

ST—Spiral to tangent station

$\Delta$  —Deflection angle for the curve system

# SUPERELEVATION

Superelevation of Curves - "superelevate" may be defined as the rotating of the roadway CROSS SECTION in such a manner as to overcome the centrifugal force that acts on the motor vehicle while it is traversing curved sections.

In other words, when you are in a curve, your car tends to be thrown to the outside of the curve. So, in order to overcome centrifugal force, it will be readily seen that the normal roadway cross section will have to be "tilted" to the superelevate cross section. This tilting is accomplished by means of rotating the cross section about the inner edge of the pavement for divided highways so that the inner edge retains its normal grade but the centerline grade is varied. On two (2) lane pavements, the tilting is accomplished by means of rotating the section about the centerline axis.

The distance required for accomplishing the transition from a NORMAL to SUPERELEVATED SECTION is called a "transitional runoff" (t) and is a function of the design speed, degree of curvature, and the rate of superelevation. Transitional runoff is between the beginning of superelevation and the beginning of full superelevation.

Turn to Sheet 690 (Standard 9028C) and look at the methods for obtaining superelevation for 2 lane pavements and divided highways.

# BEARINGS

A bearing is a method used to express direction. Bearings are used on a set of plans to indicate the magnetic direction of the Construction Line  $C_L$  and the magnetic direction of survey lines and property lines.

Bearings may be referenced to true north, magnetic north or grid north (state plane grid).

Angular measurement is referenced to a circle, and the circle can be broken into more precise measurements of minutes and seconds. There are 360 degrees in a full circle. There are 60 minutes for each degree and 60 seconds in each minute. When shown as a compass circle, the circle is divided at North, East, West, and South points into four sections of  $90^{\circ}$  each. The four  $90^{\circ}$  sections are called QUADRANTS and designated: Northeast (N.E.), Northwest (NW), Southeast (SE) and Southwest (SW). This is illustrated by Figure 7-5.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/c86e48aefccde2b42988210b2bd82b10323e3c98eb315698e872ea762a15d872.jpg)  
Figure 7-5. Compass Bearing.

All Bearings on the plans must be definitely described as to direction, degrees, minutes, and seconds. It is not sufficient to describe a line or bearing simply as Northeast or Southwest. The bearing must be described as so many degrees, minutes, and seconds in the direction in which the line is progressing. The accuracy of calculations is dependent on exact measurements of distances and bearings. A bearing might be written as N  $65^{\circ}15'30''$  E.

Bearings are the angular measurements of a line running East or West of due North; and East or West of due South. Highway bearings do not go beyond  $89^{\circ}59'$  59", which is read as 89 degrees, 59 minutes, 59 seconds. After the aforementioned bearing, they are either due East or due West, or in another quadrant.

Answer the questions:

7-10 Bearings on plans have to be described by , , and  
7-11 There are degrees in a full circle.  
7-12 In a compass circle, the four  $90^{\circ}$  sections called  
7-13 A bearing is used to express

Turn to Construction Plan Sheet No. 60 and note that the bearing on the Construction Centerline is N  $81^{\circ}18'$  11.24" E in reference to the North Arrow. This means the line is running 81 degrees, 18 minutes, and 11.24 seconds east of North/South line.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/65559b3d3d467b40c32eeadc34ded3a9c87ab0c11e1461510194a1c39be5c393.jpg)

# PROFILE VIEW (VERTICAL ALIGNMENT)

Now turn to Construction Plan Sheet 106. Look at the profile shown on the sheet. The next few pages in this book are about the PROFILE VIEW or VERTICAL ALIGNMENT.

A profile is like a longitudinal (length-wise) cross section of the roadway; rather than the left to right width of the roadway. The profile shows vertical alignment along the roadway at the centerline, survey line, construction centerline, or another point. The cut or fill on the point shown on the profile does not necessarily mean that the cut or fill will be the same at this or at any other point on the cross section. For instance, the left side of the roadway might be in a cut section while the right side might be in a fill section.

Please note that on your reduced plan sheets, in the PLAN VIEW, scale is  $\frac{1}{2}'' = 50'$  ( $1'' = 100'$ ) in the PROFILE VIEW - VERTICAL ALIGNMENT scale is  $\frac{1}{2}'' = 10'$  ( $1'' = 20'$ ). Keep this difference in mind when you look at the VERTICAL ALIGNMENT sections of the Plan Sheets.

On the Profile View, a heavy dark solid line usually shows the proposed Profile Grade Line. It is a regular and smooth line, just as the top of the roadway will be when finished being built. Look at the Profile Grade Line in the bottom section of Construction Plan Sheet No. 106. The Original Ground Line is usually shown by a dashed line and is very irregular since the original ground is irregular (or bumpy) before construction begins.

The primary purpose of the profile (grid) Profile Sheet is to show the relationship between the proposed Profile Grade and the Original Ground Line.

Circle the correct answers:

7-17 Another name for profile view is (vertical alignment / horizontal alignment).  
7-18 A profile can show the vertical alignment along the roadway at the (centerline / cross-over).  
7-19 The cut or fill on the profile (does / does not) always mean that the cut or fill will be the same on each side of the roadway.  
7-20 The proposed profile grade line is usually shown as a (solid / dashed line).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/103ccbc97105750aaa9958e8402eb563689fb8757fe36f45c4cc3dfb188fbf40.jpg)  
Figure 7-7. Profile Grade Lines.

Please refer to Figure 7-7 above and answer the questions:

7-21 In sketch A above, is the area beneath the Grade Line a cut or a fill area?

7-22 Does sketch B, above, show a cut or a fill area?

# ELEVATIONS

Elevations are given in feet above a datum. A datum is a reference surface such as sea level. These are numbers shown on the right and left edge of the Profile Sheet. Looking at Construction Plan Sheet No. 106, look at the station numbers at the bottom of the page. On each side of the gridline that is drawn from the station number are two elevation numbers. On the left side of each line is the existing grade elevation at that station number and on the right side of the line is the proposed grade elevation at that station. Note that these numbers are elevations (in feet) ABOVE sea level.

The surveyors set reference points of known elevations so that they measure differences in elevations (vertical distances). Sometimes, markers will be set in trees or in structures and their elevations determined and recorded.

These markers are called BENCH MARKS(BM) and are shown by Numbers (BM #1, BM#2, etc.) These Bench Marks may be listed on the Plan's Profile Sheets.

# GRADE

Grade is the slope of the roadway. It is expressed as a percentage of the horizontal distance.

That is, a  $+3\%$  grade means a RISE of 3 feet per 100 feet of horizontal distance.

The grade is considered to be  $+$  (positive) or  $-$  (negative) depending upon whether it rises or falls as you proceed along the GRADE LINE in the direction of increasing stations.

Circle the correct answers:

7-23 Elevations are given in (feet / yards).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/84a35244bc2d5ecbe2186148007f7852acd886b1fd8dab7fe5d83e71fcc034b8.jpg)  
Figure 7-8. Positive and Negative Grades.

7-24 The elevation numbers are shown on the (bottom / left & right) edge of the Profile Sheet.  
7-25 Reference point markers of known elevations are called (ground points / bench marks)  
7-26 (Grade / Elevation) is the slope of the roadway with a vertical rise and fall.

Look at Construction Plan Sheet 106 at the PROFILE VIEW and answer the questions:

7-27 What is the existing elevation at Sta.  $170 + 00?$  
7-28 What is the proposed elevation at Sta.  $170 + 00?$

# VERTICAL CURVES

When a road goes over a hill or mountain, it must curve over the top, (crest), or down in a valley (sag). These are VERTICAL (up and down) CURVES and are shown on the PROFILE SHEETS. They differ from horizontal curves in two ways.

1. They are parabolic and not circular curves.  
2. They define neither vertical and nor horizontal alignment.

A small triangle at the intersection of the tangents shows the P.V.I. or Point of Vertical Intersection. These P.V.I.s

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/e85b1b3d73a27017b1029c705e2c008a492725a4adb2f5c6bb2b409da3bbc998.jpg)  
Figure 7-9. Vertical Curves and P.V.I.s.

are similar to the P.I.s (Point of Intersection) for horizontal curves. Look at the P.V.I.s in Figure 7-9, and notice that the P.V.I.s are NEVER on the actual grade. They will be either above or below grade.

The beginning point of the curve is the PVC (Point of Vertical Curve), and the end of the curve is the PVT (Point of Vertical Tangent). The length between the PVC and PVT is the length of vertical curve (LVC). Almost always, the PVC to P.V.I. and P.V.I. to PVT is  $1/2$  of the LVC. The grade into the P.V.I. is  $\mathbf{g}_1$ , and the grade out of the P.V.I. is  $\mathbf{g}_2$ . A negative grade is downhill.

# GRADE POINT

The Grade Point is a point where the profile grade line (proposed roadway surface) crosses the original ground line. Refer to Figure 7-10 below.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/462285adb071dc7d9fc5baee909b65f7a377155cb86fe5686187b9ae5aa11d6b.jpg)  
Figure 7-10. Grade Points.

Fill in the blanks:

7-29 A vertical curve over a hill is referred to as a  
7-30 A vertical curve that goes in a valley is referred to as a  
7-31 The Point of Vertical Intersection is shown by a at the intersection of the tangents.  
7-32 The ________ is a point where the profile grade line crosses the original ground line.

Using Construction Plan Sheet No. 106, answer the questions:

7-33 What is the P.V.I. elevation at Sta.  $171 + 00?$  
7-34 Is the elevation above or below the construction profile?  
7-35 What is the percent of grade from Sta.  $171 + 00$  forward?

Using Construction Plan Sheet No. 111, answer the questions:

7-36 Is this vertical curve between Stations.  $302 + 50$  and  $315 + 50$  a sag or a crest?  
7-37 Where are the PVC, PVT and the P.V.I. Stations?  
7-38 What is the length of this vertical curve?

# PAVING LIMITS

Paving limits are the LENGTH AND WIDTH of the roadway to be paved. Look at Construction Plan Sheet 13. Typical sections for the crossroads are shown. Note that a different cross section is used for tangent and super elevated sections.

Using Construction Plan Sheet 13, answer the questions:

7-39 What are the tangent section paving limits for the following crossroads?

a. Jackson RD  
b. Glad RD

7-40 What are the paving widths?

# Construction Limits

The Construction Limits of grading represent either the toe of the fill or limits of the cut slopes or lateral ditches, berm ditches or surface ditches showing where the limits of the construction should be. These limits of grading are usually shown as dashed lines on the plans. Looking at Construction Plan Sheet 60, left of the survey line at Station  $155 + 00$ , you will notice that the letters "F" are part of that dashed line. This indicates that in this area, the limits will be in a fill section of the terrain. At Station  $159 + 00$ , left and right of the centerline a dashed line is shown with the letter "C." This indicates that in this area, the limits will be in a cut section of the terrain. It is possible to have cut on one side of the centerline and fill on the other.

# FENCING

Fencing is used to physically delineate the right of way of a controlled/limited access roadway or to replace fence that is along the right of way and personal property. A separate "Fencing Plan" may be included in a set of plans if the amount of fence warrants it. In most plans, fencing is pictured on the construction plans, as any other construction item would be, however, the quantities and locations are listed on the Quantity & Summary Sheets of the plans.

# GUARD RAIL

Turn to Construction Plan Sheet 676 of your set of sample plans and note the details for Guard Rail location under the various conditions. Please note that this one sheet covers only a few of many different conditions. Look at Construction Plan Sheet 77 near the bridge. The beginning, end and type of guard rail locations are shown. The Summary of Quantities would also show this information.

# RIGHT OF WAY MARKERS

Right of Way (ROW) Markers are used to physically mark the limits of the land, property, etc. that was acquired for highway purposes on the ground. Normally right of way markers are placed where there is a break in the right of way such as a PC or PT.

# Chapter 8: Drainage

# INTRODUCTION TO DRAINAGE

Project drainage is accomplished by means of ditches, pipe culverts, box culverts, bridges and minor drainage structures such as drop inlets, junction boxes, man-holes, spring boxes, endwalls, etc. The amount of water to be drained determines the type of drainage structure(s) to be built.

Although the terms of culvert and bridge are sometimes used interchangeably, they are different structures.

- A culvert is a structure not classified as a bridge that provides an opening under a roadway - usually for water drainage. Standard Specifications 101.21 defines a culvert as any structure under the roadway with a clear opening of 20 feet or less.  
- A bridge is a structure having a length of over a twenty foot span that is erected over a roadway, stream, railroad, depression, or combination of these.

Each drainage structure is pictured in the Plan Sheets (Refer to Figure 8-1 at right). Also included in plans will be a cross section view of each of the drainage structures to be installed.

# PIPE CULVERTS

Several examples of pipe culverts are found on Sheet 62. Look near station  $192 + 50$ . An 18" slope drain (SD) pipe culvert is used to drain a portion of the median and incorporates a median drop inlet. The pipe flows to a flared end section at the outfall (left side of road). Note also the profile view. This structure is identified as 10A. Construction Plan Sheet 214, median drain profiles, shows pipe profiles.

At station  $192 + 29.09$  a  $5^{\prime}\mathrm{x}4^{\prime}$  box culvert is shown. It is identified as structure 10. A portion of the existing culvert will be removed and rebuilt to accommodate the road widening. Construction Plan Sheet 202, Drainage Profiles, shows the culvert profile.

On Construction Plan Sheet No. 198, Drainage Map Plan Sheets, note the culvert details. Station location, skew angle, size, drainage area,  $Q_{50}$  (water flow rate) and receiving stream are shown.

Circle the correct answers:

8-1 Drainage structures (are / are not) pictured in the Plan/Profile Plan Sheet  
8-2 A culvert (is / is not) classified as a bridge.  
8-3 A bridge is a structure having a span length (over / under) 20 feet.

# BOX CULVERTS

You need to know the names of the different box culvert parts. Examine the following diagrams very carefully.

You should be aware of the fact that culverts can be built with more than one barrel also.

Figure 8-4. Longitudinal Section of a Box Culvert.

Notice these things particularly about the above. Shown above is a longitudinal section of a box culvert:

a. The INLET and OUTLET ends - water goes in the INLET and flows to the OUTLET end of a culvert. The INLET end is always HIGHER than the OUTLET end.  
b. The CENTERLINE FLOWLINE - is the elevation of the top of the bottom slab at the centerline of the roadway. Also known as INVERT.  
c. The PERCENT OF SLOPE for the culvert BARREL - this is shown in the longitudinal section on the drainage cross section sheet. It is established from elevations set for the inlet and outlet elevations.  
d. The SLOPE OF THE FILL - is controlled by the height of fill from the shoulder line to the toe of the slope - see typical sections.  
e. The CONSTRUCTION JOINTS - show where one concrete pour may end, and another may begin.

# PLAN VIEW

Look at the PLAN VIEW shown below for the box culvert. Wing Walls and Parapet are not shown. This plan view shows the culvert from the top. See the centerline of the roadway? Notice that the culvert is on a line perpendicular to the roadway centerline. This culvert is said to be on a 90 degree SKEW.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/6f05ee6bb5d5115855c1e01ce294f3ea1da9890f31a22ebb97f758febb8c1556.jpg)  
Figure 8-5. Plan View of a Box Culvert

This SKEW ANGLE is the angle that the centerline of the culvert makes with the centerline of the roadway as measured in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction from the centerline of the roadway looking ahead. Look at the next drawing of a 45 degree skew condition.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/88208580c2906a67eec5f46fc0d7630ed1e0cc5e0e0c21fa0411eb9e227eb4d3.jpg)  
Figure 8-6. Skew View of a Box Culvert.

Using the preceding drawings of a culvert, answer the questions and/or choose the right answer:

8-10 The end of the culvert that the water goes IN is called the ________ end. This is the (higher / lower) end.  
8-11 The culvert slopes DOWN to the end.

8-12 A place at which one concrete pour may end and join another concrete pour is called the  
8-13 The toe of the fill slope meets the back of the  
8-14 A skew angle is the angle formed by what two lines? and

Using Construction Plan Sheets 62, 198 and 202 for culvert structure 10, answer the questions:

8-16 Does water flow from left to right, or from right to left in this culvert?

to

8-17 What is the inlet elevation?  
8-18 What is the outlet elevation?  
8-19 What is the  $\%$  grade of the new portion of the culvert?

What is the  $\%$  grade of the old portion of the culvert?

# WING WALLS

The barrel of the culvert is the portion of the structure that conveys the water. Wing walls are on both ends of the barrel.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/e1005b57f7c54b6d8661f50fe55ab9198faca26600d0072e4c894dfea73eedb1.jpg)  
Figure 8-7. Part Plan View of Wing Wall

The purpose of wing walls is to keep the earth "fill" above the culvert from spilling into the stream bed. At right is a section of the wing wall on the previous drawing of a culvert.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/90c150059d516e1d0073b2069664873e1b99c5cd8936c2c661951dbcaf909884.jpg)  
Figure 8-8. Wing Wall Section.

Wing walls are extensions of the barrel walls that flare out away from the stream. Figure 8-9 shows a box culvert on a 60-degree skew. Notice how one wing is shorter than the other.

Notice that the length of each wing is such that the fill slope, as indicated by the arrowed lines, proceeds down the slope from the shoulder line of the roadway.

Therefore, the wing lengths will vary from culvert to culvert - depending upon the height of the culvert, the slope of the fill, and skew of the culvert. Turn to Standard 2328 on Sheet 655 of your example plans. Plan views for different skew angles are

shown. Notice the lengths of Wing M and Wing N. These varying wing lengths are examples of short and long wings.

The angles that the wings make with the barrel are illustrated in the part plan shown below. Note that the wings are parallel to lines that cut in half (bisect) the interior corner angles of the culvert.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/f5fd468448959b3bab4650b52c07e5f03aaa146afead73447a3160daf44018b5.jpg)  
Figure 8-9. Box Culvert on 60 degree skew.

This procedure is the normal or standard method of establishing the direction of the wings. There are special occasions (not very often) when the wings are not placed as shown in the "Part Plan" (Figure 8-10) above.

Circle the correct answers:

8-20 The purpose of a wing wall is to keep the earth (fill / cut) from entering the stream.  
8-21 Wing wall wings (are / are not) different lengths if the culvert is built on a skew.

# BRIDGES

A bridge is constructed over a roadway, stream, or railroad, or a combination of these. Refer to Figure 8-11 below for two views of a three span bridge over a roadway. Look this structure over carefully.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/d20c6ca476e1919ec7075c616d4c3a22a097c91c57b01eea2698cab7fb43f2f7.jpg)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/9301104cdc9401f9ccc48b137e8394dc128b8e4f82ea8a775ae646ab4e59d528.jpg)  
Figure 8-11. Plan and Elevation Views of a Bridge

Notice these things particularly on the views of the bridge:

1. Look at SPANS A, B, and C - These Spans make up the riding surface of the bridge and consist of a reinforced concrete deck (slab) supported on steel or concrete BEAMS or GIRDERS that is supported on the end by BENTs.  
2. BEAMS OR GIRDERS - These are placed lengthwise along the bridge (parallel to the Centerline of the Bridge as shown in the PLAN VIEW) with each end resting on the BENT CAP. They can be made of steel or concrete. They directly support the roadway slab.  
3. BENT - considered to be composed of the BENT CAP, COLUMN, FOOTING, AND THE PILES, beneath the footing or the Bent Cap and the Pile supporting the cap (in some instances, there are no columns or footings such as a stream crossing, this is known as a pile bent).  
4. BENT CAPS - These are constructed of reinforced concrete and are supported either by means of concrete or steel PILES or reinforced concrete columns. End Bents normally use Piles.

5. FOOTINGS - These support the Columns and are constructed of reinforced concrete. Footings are supported either on Piles or firm soil. Footings are not seen once the bridge has been constructed since they will be covered with earth.  
6. PILES - Piles are used when there is no firm material available to support a footing. Steel piles are used in areas where rock is found; concrete piles are also used in areas where steel piles would corrode easily such as in coastal areas.  
7. SUPERSTRUCTURE OF A BRIDGE - This is the part of the bridge that is above the top of the bent caps.  
8. SUBSTRUCTURE OF A BRIDGE - This is the part of the bridge that is below the top of the Bent Caps.  
9. FILL - This is the earth that was required to be placed on top of the existing ground to provide the foundation for the roadway.  
10. FILL SLOPE - This is the slope of the earth which has been placed on existing ground. Fill slope is normally 2:1 for bridges over highways and streams.  
11. CUT SLOPE - The slope beneath a bridge can also be a cut slope. This would be the case where the bridge is to be built on an existing roadway and the earth below the bridge must be removed to provide for the roadway below.

# BENTS

The following are views of the most common types of Interior and End Bents that you will find in structure plans. The views show what you would see if you cut a section across a bridge between bents.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/55ad90bb14d9cc95cbc46586325dbcce47e8f5abcf3eae52d76dc52a902e1a06.jpg)  
Figure 8-12. End Bent Elevations.

Turn to Construction Plan Sheet 535. This bridge is a bridge widening. The existing bridge is being constructed for the widening. The elevation, left bridge, shows the new pile foundation. The elevation, bent 3 right bridge shows angle iron supports being added.

Using the previous drawings and information, answer the questions:

8-22 The two main parts of a bridge are ______ and ______. (Hint - Above & Below Bent Cap)  
8-23 The supporting members that hold up (directly support) the roadway slab and the traffic on this slab are ________ or ________.  
8-24 The supporting members in Question 8-23 are supported at each end by a _______ or _______  
8-25 The portion of the bridge that supports the Superstructure is called the  
8-26 Depending on the ground, Bent Footings may be supported in two ways. These are _______ or _______.  
8-27 What are the two types of piles normally used? and  
8-28 What two materials are beams or girders made of? _______ or _______

# UTILITY ACCOMMODATIONS

Often it is necessary for UTILITIES such as water lines, gas lines, telephone lines, power lines and others to cross the roadway spanned by a bridge. The cross section below shows how utilities are supported below a bridge slab.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/5f0bc865a4c50d0a2bbe3b7d8c4f578e571f17709691a41a7ec5107c8418b46e.jpg)  
Figure 8-13. Cross Section of Bridge.

Notice the following things shown on the preceding drawing of a cross section of a bridge. Remember that you are looking at a cross sectional side view of Section A-A.

1. The concrete inserts are placed in the slab when the concrete is poured. The  $\frac{3}{4}$  hangers are then screwed into the bottom of the insert when the utility is put in place.  
2. The utilities are normally placed inside the exterior beams and above the bottom of the beam so they cannot be readily seen by anyone passing under the bridge in a vehicle.  
3. The utilities must clear the steel diaphragm. At times the diaphragm may have to be adjusted up or down to permit the utility to be placed on the bridge.  
4. The lines or conduits are normally located by the dimensions d1, d2, d3, and d4 as shown.

Using the previous bridge cross sections, answer the questions:

8-29 What three utilities are shown in the cross-section?

8-30 How many and what size telephone conduits are shown?

Utility details are more difficult at the end of a bridge. The view below is one looking at the beginning or the ending end of a bridge which shows the end wall that pipes and conduits must pass through. The bottom section is a profile view at the end bent.

Examine each diagram carefully.

Figure 8-14. End Bent Elevation and Section

Notice the following things shown on the previous End Elevation drawing:

1. The end wall that the utilities must pass through is a reinforced concrete wall that is poured at the same time as the concrete slab is poured.  
2. Note the pipe sleeves that are cast in the end wall for the pipes to pass through. Also, see the opening that is left for the telephone conduits.

# Chapter 9: Utility Plans

Utility plans are used primarily to facilitate coordination between the construction contractor and utility companies having facilities in the roadway corridor. (The DOT is not involved in the relocation of utilities unless it is done under a Force Account). These plans show the contractor the approximate locations of existing, relocated, and proposed new utilities aiding the designer and contractor in identifying and/or avoiding conflicts or damage to facilities. Information is typically obtained from either field survey data and/or the affected utility owner.

Construction Plan Sheet 419 is an example utility plan. Note the gas lines shown before Station  $180 + 00$ . One gas line is being relocated, and the other remains in the original location. Also note the Colonial Pipeline dig notification requirement.

Please identify the following statement as True or False.

9-1 True False Utility plans show the exact location of the utilities of the project.

Plans are also prepared consisting of signs and pavement markings. These plans are normally in the same general format as the roadway plans.

All permanent roadway signs and pavement markings are placed on the plans as they are supposed to appear upon completion of the project. See Construction Plan Sheet No. 474 for an example of this.

# Chapter 10: Signing and PavementMarkings, Signals, Highway Lighting & Landscaping

All required pavement markings are depicted on the plans including the color, width, and spacing, etc. Call-outs may be provided to identify the type of each line on Plan Sheet. All required arrows and hatching in accordance with Department Standards are included. Each arrow may not be labeled but at least one note referencing the applicable standard is included on each sheet.

A summary of the quantities for any overhead signs typically follow the sign/pavement marking plans. For post mounted signs, a summary is included with the normal Summary of Quantities Plan Sheets discussed previously in Chapter 4. It lists the location, installation number, sign codes, etc. for each sign.

# TRAFFIC SIGNALS

The signalization plans will show the complete site layout, equipment details, electrical circuitry, signal phasing, and other relevant data for the installation of traffic signal(s). A separate plan sheet(s) for each intersection requiring signalization will be provided. A summary table of items needed for each of intersection will be included showing the name of the item, the method of payment and the quantity to be used for each of the installation(s).

See Construction Plan Sheet 523 for a sample of an installation.

# LIGHTING

Highway lighting plans are required when a project involves lighting improvements. The lighting plans are to provide a comprehensive set of construction details, electrical circuit tabulations, pole data summaries, conduit descriptions, service point locations, luminaire type and intensity, foundations and details, and all other specific data relevant to the construction of all lighting related features and components.

If the project consists of high mast lighting towers, it is also required that a soil survey and foundation design is done.

# LANDSCAPING

Projects which require landscaping may require a separate set of plans, at the Department's direction. These plans may be included in the roadway contract or as a stand-alone set of plans.

The following information is usually provided in landscape plans:

1. An overall Site Plan and an area map depicting the roadway corridor in relation to the surrounding environment

2. A Planting Plan  
3. A Planting Plan Detail  
4. An Irrigation Plan

Circle the correct answers:

10-1 Sign and Pavement Marking Plans (are /are not) normally in the same format as roadwayplans.  
10-2 Plans (do / do not) indicate the color, width and/or spacing of the pavement markings.  
10-3 Traffic Signal Plans (do / do not) have a summary of items needed for each intersection.  
10-4 Lighting Plans (are / are not) required when the project involves extensive lighting improvements.  
10-5 List two (2) things that are to be included in a set of Landscape Plans.

1.  
2.

Using Construction Plan Sheet 474, answer the following questions:

10-6 What size skip stripe is to be placed on the right side of the project centerline from Station  $153 + 00$  to  $165 + 00$ ?  
10-7 What size and color stop bar is to be placed on Rehoboth Road?

The Traffic Control Plan consists of the plans and specifications developed for each individual construction project, supplemented by such detailed plans as required by the contract. The Traffic Control Plan complements the Traffic Control Specifications and the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).

# Chapter 11: Maintenance of Traffic, Sequence of Operations, and Staging

Special attention is given to constructability, traffic handling, detours, restrictions to traffic, hours of closure/lane loss, and responsibility of the contractor. Signing and markings for the Traffic Control Plans are included for projects such as off-site detours and projects of unusual complexity. Routine projects do not necessarily identify specific signs, markings, and other devices ordinarily required by the Specifications and Standard Drawings.

Preliminarily, specific Traffic Control Plan sheets for each stage of construction using information from the plan sheets and intersection and interchange layout sheets are prepared. For each construction stage, plans show the roadway areas and major drainage structure to be constructed, along with traffic flow patterns, including lane widths, for the stage. Indicate on the plan areas of temporary pavement, locations of temporary barriers, and any temporary drainage structures.

Also included on these plan sheets is a narrative of the sequence of construction and of the handling of traffic for each stage. Where necessary, cross sections of the stage indicating the area to be constructed along with the area to be used to maintain traffic are included, showing any areas of temporary pavement and any temporary barriers.

If an on-site detour is required, detour plans with cross sections and signing are usually included showing detour centerline/baseline with curve and alignment data, detour profile, pavement edges, pavement width, construction limits of the detour, required right-of-way and easements, temporary drainage, and temporary barriers if necessary. If a road closing and an off-site detour is required, there will be a plan showing a layout of the local roads with the road closure points and the detour route.

Please answer the following true/false questions:

11-1 True False Traffic Control Plans are general and are used from project to project.  
11-2 True False Detours are not given any attention in a set of Traffic Control Plans.  
11-3 True False Cross sections of each construction stage are always included in the plans.

# Chapter 12: Erosion, Sedimentation, and Pollution Control Plans (ESPCP)

# INTRODUCTION

Steep embankments, ditches, or other exposed surfaces adjacent to a roadway require some means to be taken to keep exposed soil from eroding away by the action of wind, water, and freezing and thawing action of the weather. Depending upon the need, erosion control measures such as grassing, silt fence, paved ditches, straw mulch, silt gates, baled straw, and other devices such as bituminous treated glass fiber, soil reinforcing mats, etc. may be used.

In creating the Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plans (ESPCP), references such as the most recent Department's Uniform Code System For Soil Erosion And Sediment Control Design Guidelines (Section 161 of the Department Specifications), the Department's Manual On Drainage Design For Highways, the Department's Standard Specifications Construction of Roads and Bridges, the Department's Construction Details, and the Georgia State Soil And Water Conservation Commission Manual For Erosion And Sediment Control in Georgia, to name a few, may be used in preparing the Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plans (ESPCP) and/or package.

# WHEN ARE ESPCP NecessARY?

If the total project disturbs less than one (1) acres only a set of BMP (Best Management Practices) Location Details are prepared and included in the project construction plans. BMP's are either structural or vegetative. Structural measures are structures that control erosion such as rip-rap or paved ditches. Vegetative measures are methods such as grassing, sod or soil matting.

Figure 12-1. Erosion, Sediment & Pollution Control Plan

If the total project disturbs 1 acre or more, there will be a standalone erosion control package. This package will be placed at the back of a set of final construction plans.

# WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE ESPCP?

Included in ESPCP standalone package you should find the following sheets:

Cover Sheet (Construction Type)

- General Note Sheet

- Drainage Area Map

- BMP Plan Sheets (Best Management Practices)

The sheets are designed with the same scale and matchlines as the construction plans.

Figure 12-2. Stage 1 BMP Plan Sheet: Location Details.

# CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITIES

The Department of Transportation provides all these plans; however, if there are any changes to the staging, the contractor is responsible for revising the plans. In addition, the contractor is responsible for the ESPCP for borrow pits, haul roads, and waste pits.

# EXAMPLES

Berm ditches may require concrete ditch paving as erosion control measures. The limits and quantities are noted in the Summary of Quantities.

Erosion control measures are identified by standard symbols. Measures shown on Construction Plan Sheet 721 include Co (construction exit), Sd3 (temporary sediment basin), and Ch (channel stabilization). These measures are considered structural BMPs. All measures required for the project are found in the construction details.

Circle the correct answers:

12-1 If a total project is (greater / less) than one (1) acres a set of Erosion Control Plans will be included in a separate package and attached to the back of the project plans.  
12-2 The Department of Transportation has to develop and submit erosion control plans according to Specification Section (161 / 611)

# Chapter 13: Cross Sections

# INTRODUCTION TO CROSS SECTIONS

Cross Sections depict the existing ground conditions, including all man-made features, as sections perpendicular to the construction centerline or baseline. The proposed cross-sectional outline of the new roadway with all its elements is also shown on the cross sections. Standard Cross Section Plan Sheets are used for showing the roadway cross sections. The recommended scale is  $1" = 100'$  or  $1" = 200'$ . If the entire cross section cannot be shown on one sheet, the sheets may be turned horizontally or more sheets with appropriate match lines shown are used.

Existing ground lines are shown with a dashed line. A note of the existing ground line elevation at the profile grade line (PGL) just below the ground line is shown. The surface and subgrade of the existing construction such as pavements, curbs, and sidewalks are shown also with a dashed line. If present, the limits of unsuitable material are shown. The station number of the section is normally shown in heavy numbers to the right of or below the cross section.

The proposed roadway template is shown with a solid line. The proposed profile grade elevation is vertically shown just above the profile grade line. If there are any special ditches, the elevations are normally included as well. Any and all station equations are shown, even if a cross section may not be plotted at that point.

Roadway Cross Section Plan sheets are usually lined up in a similar way to the list below:

1. Mainline  
2. Cross Streets  
3. Side Streets  
4. Ramps  
5. Major Driveways

# EARTHWORK

Figure 13-1 is an illustration of typical terrain upon which a two-lane roadway is shown. The illustration can only be a general picture, but it does convey a third dimension-depth, which a plan view cannot show. Within the illustration, you can see one item of construction that is changing from station to station and that item is earthwork (cubic yards of dirt).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/852e96733fdf325eb4b6943b315d92033028130c0500155133bfffa2af1add63.jpg)  
Figure 13-1. Typical terrain for a Two-Lane Roadway

Because earthwork is usually a costly item in highway construction, it must be accounted for in the estimate prepared for the project. Since it would be extremely difficult to measure the exact amount of earthwork in a project, the designer resorts to approximation. This is accomplished by using the Cross Section Plan Sheets.

Remember that the cross section shows what you would see if the highway were cut at right angles to the centerline.

See the next illustration with examples of cross sections taken in cut and in fill:

The cross section is not always all cut or all fill as shown previously; it may also be part cut and part fill.

Many factors are considered before combining a typical section of the roadway with a cross section of the ground.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/312ac2236c505eee59b847d1b2c1a30e892cd0808bd82e1bc4a5035548952ce5.jpg)

Figure 13-3. Typical Cross Section.

The typical section represents an end view of the pavement necessary to carry the type and volume of traffic established in the highway design.

Figure 13-4. Typical Cross Section along Centerline.

The cross section of the original ground is distinctive for every location along the centerline.

By combining the typical section and the cross section of the original ground, a determination is made of the area of cut, fill, or both.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/6469bba3d96229502ca95c420bb3e3f98ae644242a6d0f6b50ed8a64eb9cfdd3.jpg)  
Figure 13-5. Cross Section at Station 194+50.

The drawing on Figure 13-6 shows how depth (100 ft.) is multiplied by an averaging of end areas to give a "volume" answer. The vertical point of reference for a typical section at a particular location along the roadway is called the profile grade.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/8572d4f6bb2099bdc70c90d6b4f822d5f073bb9838843a8730e179c344fc4d54.jpg)  
Figure 13-6. Volume of Cut.

On projects where the amount of dirt is over a set amount by the Department, the earthwork is paid for as a Cubic Yard item and not Lump Sum. The District Earthwork Coordinator will verify the cubic yard amount of earthwork at the beginning of each project. Project personnel will pay up to  $95\%$  of the verified quantity of earthwork per the Standard Specifications until final dressing, etc. is complete.

Upon completion of the final dressing, project personnel should submit to the District Earthwork Coordinator a list of all areas where the contractor deviated from the plan template with approval of the Department. This form is the "Earthwork Template Exceptions List". In the case that the project was built without any exceptions, project personnel should send a letter stating such to the District Earthwork Coordinator as well.

# GRADE

Look at Construction Plan Sheet 236, a Cross Section Plan Sheet, and note that the profile grade elevation (top elevation) listed for  $196 + 00$  is 880.82. The lower elevation is the finished grade for the ditch. The smaller elevation just below and right of the profile grade elevation is the existing grade. Turn to Construction Plan Sheet 106 and verify the elevations at Sta.  $196 + 00$ . Now turn to Construction Plan Sheet 8 for the typical section and compare the required grading template to the plotted cross section. Note that the profile grade is at the center of the median.

# SLOPES

Slopes are usually referred to as "cut slopes" (back slopes), "fill slopes" and "side slopes" (front slopes). A cut slope is that portion of the roadway between the side drainage ditch and the top of the cut. A fill slope is that portion of roadway between the shoulder point of the roadway and the toe of the fill. The side slope is that portion of the roadway between the shoulder point and the adjacent drainage ditch. These slopes are measured as a ratio of horizontal distance (from and to edge of pavement) versus each foot of decrease or increase in elevation (height).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/cd00551920c41de5e77b0ce2f753e6718eda5a7bbe6b07502e95bb05f8b63f07.jpg)  
Figure 13-7. Views of Slopes in Cross Section  
Figure 13-7 shows some views of the various slopes used on cross sections.

A 2:1 slope means that for every 2 feet of horizontal distance, the elevation (or vertical distance) increases (cut section) or decreases (fill section) 1 foot, depending on the type of slope shown on the previous drawing.

Using Cross Section Construction Plan Sheet No. 236, look at Sta.  $194 + 50$ . Notice that the left side slopes shown here is a 2:1 slope which is a "fill slope". Look now at Construction Plan Sheet 8 - Typical Section - and notice that a fill slope over 10 feet will have a 2:1 slope and that guardrail will be required in this section because of the depth of fill.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/0e404dee5ba2f2ac17c5720687f1dbc6b3289bc126d27d5425d16382f2416240.jpg)  
Figure 13-8. Slope Cross Section.

# SLOPE STAKES

The following information is a general guide only. Information on these stakes varies with various contractors, surveyors, and districts. Stakes contain information that tells the Contractor how much "cut" or "fill" is required from the point of the stake to the ditch line (or shoulder point) of the roadway, depending on whether the stake is in a cut or in a fill section.

Slope stakes are placed at the point of intersection of the cut or fill slope and the natural ground line.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/5e85e589ab092a2e87b11120118ac0f6ed9be81ca28cc615cff80117e5972495.jpg)

Figure 13-9. Slope Stake Positioning

The following information may be shown on the side of the slope stake facing the roadway (this would be the front of the stake). Refer to Figure 13-10 below.

1. Indicates cut (C) or fill (F)  
2. The amount of cut (to the bottom of the ditch) or the amount of fill (to the shoulder point).  
3. The distance from the stake to the centerline of the roadway or some other reference line.  
4. The rate of slope (such as 2:1)  
5. The rate of super elevation (only required when roadway is in a curve section).

Figure 13-10: Station Numbering on Slope Stake.

The station number is shown on the side of the stake away from the roadway or back of the stake. Refer the right side of Figure 13-10 above.

Often, slope stakes are offset in order to allow the Contractor to perform his work without destroying the slope stakes. In this case, information should be shown in the same manner as the in-place slope stake except that the following additional information should be shown encircled on the front of the offset stake.

- The distance from the offset stake location to the slope stake location.  
- The change in elevation between the slope stake location and the offset location as indicated by a + or a - depending on whether the offset stake location is higher + or lower - than the slope stake location.

# Chapter 14: Standards & Details

# INTRODUCTION TO STANDARDS AND DETAILS

"Georgia Construction Standard Drawings" or Standards are generalized construction drawings that are applicable to most construction projects. Think of Standards as drawings of the normal way the Department of Transportation wants something built or to be done.

"Georgia Construction Detail Drawings" or Details are a more specific and specialized way that the Department wants something built. It will usually be something that is not as common a way of doing something on most construction projects.

"Georgia Special Construction Details" are drawings that are specific and specialized to that project only.

Turn to the Index Sheet and note that Construction Plan Sheets 566-631 are Construction Details and Sheets 632-707 are Construction Standards and are to be used on the job. Two of these Standard Drawings, Construction Plan Sheet No. 690 (9028C Superelevation) and Construction Plan Sheet No. 694 (9031S Median Drop Inlet), are included as examples.

# INTERSECTION DETAILS

Intersection details are larger scale views showing detailed information that could not be shown clearly on a smaller scale normal Plan Sheet.

# Chapter 15: Right of Way

# INTRODUCTION

In order to construct any highway, the Right of Way Office must be successful in securing the needed land for right of way purposes. The Right of Way Office personnel, in most instances, are the first official contact that the property owner will have with the Department. It is imperative that they also be competent in highway plan reading so that the plans can properly be interpreted for a highway project to the property owner.

The property owner, above anyone else, is most vitally concerned as to how a proposed highway will affect his own property. The Right of Way specialist will be required to answer questions concerning the plans in addition to the general questions concerning the right of way acquisition procedure. On the initial contact with the property owner, it is of prime importance to properly interpret the highway plans for the owner as well as explain other phases of the right of way acquisition procedure.

Many times the owner will ask questions regarding ingress (enter in) and egress (exit from) of a proposed highway; how cuts and fills will affect his property; and how his residence or business will be affected by the highway project. The farmer is particularly interested in such matters as how his fields and pastures will be divided by a proposed highway; how his woodland will be affected; how the access to water will be affected; and the appropriation and relocation of fencing.

Farmers will also ask questions regarding the movement and protection of livestock; how the construction schedule of the project will affect his planting, growing, and harvesting seasons; and many other questions such as the appropriation of farm outbuildings and his access to the proposed highway facility. These are only a few of the questions that a Right of Way Specialist may be asked by a property owner, and the importance of highway plan reading cannot be stressed too much. If a Right of Way Specialist is hesitant about answering questions regarding the plans, due to his lack of knowledge, the property owner is apt to become defensive and the Specialist will have a difficult time in acquiring the property.

In Urban areas, the Right of Way Specialist should be particularly careful in noting the "cuts" and "fills" as indicated on the plans. Major "cuts" and "fills" can affect locations as to where driveways can be reconnected. It is entirely possible that the depth of a cut or the height of a fill could eliminate a driveway from being reconnected even though the project has no limited or control of access.

Urban property owners are particularly interested in such matters as to the appropriation of landscaping, how close a roadway is to a dwelling or business, driveway reconnections, and parking on a proposed street. Property owners may have more questions regarding highway construction. In many instances, a property owner will move a residence or commercial building, which is located within the right of way limits of a highway project to a new location.

For these reasons, it is imperative that the Right of Way Specialist properly and accurately interprets the plans and read slope stakes. Highway plan reading is of vital importance to employees of all sections of the Right of Way Office and all employees should take full advantage of this Plan Reading Course.

# RIGHT OF WAY PLAN SHEETS

Right of Way Plans are a separate set of plans from the construction Plans. In going through this section of the manual, you will find yourself being referenced to a sample set of a Right of Way Plans. You will find those sheets at the back of your sample pack of Plan Sheets that you received when you began this manual.

In your set of plans, you will find two (2) Cover Sheets for "Proposed Right of Way SR 16—Arthur K. Bolton Parkway." Notice the Sheet Number differences for the Cover Sheet. The Right of Way information begins on Cover Sheet Number 1 and finishes on Sheet number 2. The construction plans had one coversheet. Similar to construction plans, a revision summary sheet is also included (Sheet 3).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/e4eeec6f8f8d79edfc2a02f509a71720e22c2ec3a66b5dcd427e0f49b20840bb.jpg)  
Figure 15-1. Right of Way Plan Sheet: Cover Sheets 1 and 2.

While there are similarities between a Construction Cover Sheet (page 4) and a Right of Way Cover Sheet, there are also differences.

# A. Similarities

1. Title of Description - "SR16—Arthur K. Bolton Parkway" in Spalding and Butts counties. It is a federal-aid project, but the project involved partial limited access and is not on a Federal route. The interstate improvements are on I-75.  
2. Project Number - you will notice that the Right of Way Sheets included in your sample pack of plans is STP-IM022-1(26) and IM-0000-00(523), the same as the construction plans. Between the time the Right of Way plans are developed, in the Preconstruction phase of a project, and the time the project reaches the Construction phase, slight changes may be made, such as an administrative or funding source change. This could cause a change in the Project Number.  
3. Location Sketch - both Cover Sheets have a location sketch on them.  
4. Sheet Identification Block - both have blocks in the upper right corner showing the project number, the sheet number, and the total number of sheets. This set of Right of Way plans has 82 sheets compared with the 770 sheets in the construction plans.  
5. Scale & Length of Project - both have a Scale Box & a Length Box. Sometimes the Gross length of Construction plans may be different than the Right of Way Length. It is likely that a difference is the distance needed to tie into the existing construction where the right of way was already purchased and the new construction.  
6. Miscellaneous - both sets of cover sheets have information attesting to their legal status and the basis on which they are developed.

# B. Differences

1. Property Owners - instead of an Index, the Right of Way Cover Sheet shows adjoining parcels and a number identifying the parcel (rectangular boxes with numbers).  
2. Plan View - the Plan View shows the project in the relationship to the affected property lines rather than the topographical landmarks of a Construction Cover Sheet.  
3. Conventional Symbols - notice, particularly, the block in the upper right side. You should pay close attention to the slight variations among the various types of lines. Refer to Figure 15-2 for an example of a Conventional Symbol block.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-12-24/d749dbdf-4f40-47d0-9280-402a52c61f01/4ce0e9a934ed511d3fe674e72b1fb59827f3b7a0b0f3db20fdc7c2496f3286cf.jpg)  
Figure 15-2. Right of Way Plans Sheet 1.

Refer to Sheet 3 of the Right of Way Plans included with your set of sample plans, which shows the following information. Parcels are identified by a rectangular box with the name of the owner underneath (See Figure 15-3 at right). These circled numbers correspond to the circled numbers on the cover sheet and show the location of the property owned by that person or company who will be affected by the project.

Land Lot Lines are thin, dashed lines distinguished from "Req'd R/W & Limit of Access" lines by the thickness and the letters L.L.L. (Right of Way Limit Lines are thicker or "blacker" than the Land Lot Lines (L.L.L.).

Notice the group of four (4) numbers that occur on the Cover Sheet at the intersection of each of the L.L.L.'s. The numbers refer to the Land Lots that are adjoining at that point.

Figure 15-3.  
Right of Way Plan Sheet 3, Parcel 4.

Using the Cover Sheet, answer the question:

15-1 What are the Land Lot Numbers in which parcel 4 is located?

The letters P & L written on the line identifies property lines. Usually a property line is a thin solid line broken by a single dash. Notice that the symbol for existing Right of Way is the same as that for a property line, but without the P.L. This applies to the Right of Way Plans. On Construction Plans, existing Right of Way is shown by long, broken thin lines. Look at Construction Right of Way Plan Sheet 61, near Station  $175 + 00$ , either to the right or left for an example of this.

Using Right of Way Plan Sheet 31, answer the questions:

15-2 Locate the property of Frank Chen, Parcel 37. At what station point and offset does the property line between Chen and Holcomb intersect the required right of way?

Property information that details the right of way taking is either shown on the same plan sheet on which the property is shown, or on a separate plan sheet. The property being taken will be described by a point, offset/distance, station/bearing and alignment. The point reference is shown on the right of way plan sheet. The offset/distance is the offset from centerline, and the distance is to the next right of way point. The station/bearing is the station of the point, and the bearing is to the next right of way point. The alignment indicates what construction centerline is being used (mainline or side road). Using Figure 15-4 from KC25004 to KC25005 is 48.252

feet at a bearing of N  $88^{\circ}$  34' 56.99" E. Point KC25004 is 38.630 feet left of Rehoboth Road at Station 10+75.

Similar information is also given for required drive easements, temporary easements, construction easements, and limited access.

Figure 15-4. Parcel Required Right of Way.

On this project, there are a number of

construction and/or drive easements. An easement is giving permission to temporarily use a part of someone's private property to perform an act of construction for a set amount of time.

By looking at the Right of Way Plan Sheets, you can identify most of the locations at a glance. They are marked with diagonal shadings. To see one of these locations, look at Right of Way Plan Sheet Number 3 at Parcel Number 3.

Using Right of Way Plan Sheet 31 and 32 (data on Parcel No. 37) to answer the questions:

15-3 How much right of way is required on Frank Chen's property (Parcel No. 37)?  
15-4 How many feet of limited access is required for the same property?
