# Chapter 1: Beginning to Read Plans

## General Information

Highway construction plans follow a standardized format established by the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT). Understanding this format is essential for contractors, engineers, and inspectors working on GDOT projects.

The contract documents establish the requirements for construction. When reading plans, always refer to the specifications and special provisions for detailed requirements. These documents are legally binding and define the scope of work.

## Requirements and Specifications

The Standard Specifications for Construction of Transportation Systems contains the general requirements that apply to all projects. These specifications are supplemented by:

- **Special Provisions**: Project-specific requirements that modify or add to the Standard Specifications
- **Supplemental Specifications**: Updates to the Standard Specifications
- **Standard Drawings**: Approved detail drawings referenced in the plans

### What Part of the Contract Applies?

In case of a discrepancy, certain parts of the contract govern over others. According to subsection 102.04 of the Standard Specifications, the order of precedence is:

1. Special Provisions
2. Plans (Construction Drawings)
3. Supplemental Specifications
4. Standard Specifications
5. Standard Drawings

This hierarchy ensures that project-specific requirements take precedence over general standards.

## Sheet Order

Construction plans are organized in a specific sequence to facilitate navigation. The typical sheet order is:

1. **Cover Sheet**: Project identification and overview
2. **Index and Revision Summary**: List of all sheets and changes
3. **Typical Sections**: Standard roadway cross-sections
4. **Summary of Quantities**: Total material quantities
5. **Plan and Profile Sheets**: Horizontal and vertical alignments
6. **Drainage Plans**: Storm water management details
7. **Cross Sections**: Detailed earthwork sections
8. **Standards and Details**: Reference drawings

Familiarizing yourself with this order will help you quickly locate specific information within the plan set.

## Errors or Omissions

If you discover errors or omissions in the construction plans, you must report them immediately to the Engineer as required by subsection 104.03 of the Standard Specifications. Do not proceed with work that may be affected by the discrepancy.

Clear communication about plan errors helps prevent costly rework and ensures project quality. Document any discrepancies in writing and obtain resolution before proceeding.

## Cover Sheet

The cover sheet is the first and most important page of any construction plan set. It contains critical project identification information.

### Description

The project description provides essential information:
- **Project Number and P.I. Number**: Unique identifiers for the project
- **Route Information**: Highway or road designation
- **County**: Location of the project
- **Project Limits**: Beginning and ending points

### Project Location Sketch

A location map shows where the project is situated within the county and state highway system. This helps orient readers to the project area.

### Layout View

The layout view shows the overall project configuration, including:
- Alignment of the roadway
- Major intersections
- Significant features

### Sheet Identification

Each sheet contains a standard identification box showing:
- Sheet number (e.g., "1 of 45")
- Project identification numbers
- Date of plans
- Engineer's seal and signature

*The image shows a highway plan cover sheet from a Georgia DOT training manual. It includes details such as project identification, location maps, and organizational elements for construction plans.*

![Figure 1-3: LAYOUT VIEW](figures\chapter_01\fig_1-2.png)
*This image shows a sample project cover sheet from the Georgia Department of Transportation's training manual. It includes details like project identification numbers, location maps, and an overview of sheet organization.*

![Figure 1-4: above is a “Plan View” of the project. You will be exposed to a PLAN VIEW in another section of this](figures\chapter_01\fig_1-3.png)
*This image shows a schematic from a highway plan, featuring various legends, scales, and organizational details used in construction planning. It is designed to instruct readers on interpreting the basic elements of a highway plan cover sheet.*

![Figure 1-9: Civil engineer’s scale (above top)](figures\chapter_01\fig_1-4.png)
*The image depicts a scaled ruler, which is typically used in construction plan reading to measure distances accurately. It shows gradations for different scales, allowing precise interpretations of drawings.*

![Figure 1-10: Detail of the Engineer’s Scale.](figures\chapter_01\fig_1-5.png)
*The image shows two types of scale rulers commonly used in drafting and construction. These scales have multiple rulers on different sides, each calibrated for specific measurement ratios.*

## Plans Revised and Plans Completed

The cover sheet tracks plan revisions through dated entries. Each revision is documented with:
- Revision number
- Date of revision
- Brief description of changes

This creates an audit trail of plan modifications throughout the project.

## Scale

Understanding scale is critical for accurately reading plans. GDOT plans use engineering scales, not architectural scales.

### Civil Engineer's Scale

The civil engineer's scale is divided into decimal units:
- 10 scale: 1 inch = 10 feet
- 20 scale: 1 inch = 20 feet
- 30 scale: 1 inch = 30 feet
- 40 scale: 1 inch = 40 feet
- 50 scale: 1 inch = 50 feet
- 60 scale: 1 inch = 60 feet

### Bar Scale

Many sheets include a bar scale (graphical scale) for quick reference. This is particularly useful when plans are reproduced at different sizes, as the bar scale changes proportionally with the drawing.

![Figure 3-1: shows an idealized roadway typical section with the various elements identified.](figures\chapter_01\fig_1-9.png)
*This image illustrates a typical cross section of a roadway with various labeled components such as slopes, travel lanes, and ditches. The diagram provides measurements and labels that help identify each part of the roadway structure and its corresponding role within the construction plan.*

## Project Length and Design Data

### Project Length

The project length is stated on the cover sheet and defines the extent of work. This is calculated based on the stationing from the beginning to the end of the project.

### Design Data

Design data on the cover sheet provides key parameters:
- **Design Speed**: The speed used for design calculations
- **Posted Speed**: The legal speed limit
- **Terrain Type**: Level, rolling, or mountainous
- **Traffic Data**: ADT (Average Daily Traffic) and design year projections

This information affects many design decisions throughout the project.
