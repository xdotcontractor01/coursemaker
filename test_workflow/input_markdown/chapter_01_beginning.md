GENERAL INFORMATION

REQUIREMENTS AND SPECIFICATIONS

A requirement occurring in one of the parts of a Georgia DOT contract is as binding as though occurring in all. The Specifications, Supplemental Specifications, Plans, Special Provisions, and all supplementary documents are all part of the contract.

WHAT PART OF THE CONTRACT APPLIES?

In case of a discrepancy, certain parts of the contract govern over others. The governing order will be as follows:

Special Provisions Project Plans including Special Plan Details Supplemental Specifications Standard Plans including Standard Construction Details Standard Specifications Calculated dimensions will govern over scaled dimensions.

The Contractor shall take no advantage of any apparent error or omissions in the Plans or Specifications. In the event the Contractor discovers such an error or omission, he shall immediately notify the Engineer. The Engineer will then make such corrections and interpretations as may be deemed necessary for fulfilling the intent of the Plans or Specifications.

SHEET ORDER

When the plans for a contract are completed, the sheets are normally placed in a specific order. (The following list is used as a general guide and is sometimes changed to better fit an individual project).

Cover Sheet

The front sheet of a set of plans is called the COVER SHEET. The information shown on it is

Project name Project number Project identification number (P.I. No.) County Congressional district Standard note directing attention to the Georgia DOT Standard Specification Book Project location sketch Box containing revisions Project limits (shown in large scale) Box containing the length of the project Federal Route Number (if applicable) State Route Number (if applicable) Signature Boxes for those responsible for the Design of the Plans Signature Box for the Chief Engineer or Responsible Official Date the Plans were completed Professional Engineer's Stamp If room is available, the following is included:

Legend of Items used in the Plans Sheet Layout Diagram An Index, if the project is small enough ![Image description](Map showing the location of Griffin, Georgia, and surrounding roads and highways. In the center of the image is a plan and profile of proposed S. R. 16, Rehoboth Road to Interstate 75. The plan shows the route of the road, with details of bridges and other features. The profile shows the elevation of the road. The image also includes survey and coordinate data, and other information about the project.) Turn to the COVER SHEET, Construction Plan Sheet 1 and see how many of the above features you can identify on your own.

Please answer the following questions:

1-1 What gives you the basic description of the project? 1-2 What gives you the beginning and ending project limits?

DESCRIPTION

Looking at your set of plans you should have found this description.

![Image description](A box containing the title 'PLAN AND PROFILE OF PROPOSED S.R. 16 REHOBOTH ROAD TO INTERSTATE 75' on white background.) Figure 1-2. Description of Project.

You will note that the proposed project is for construction of SR 16 in Spalding and Butts Counties.

Chapter 1: Beginning to Read Plans

The next thing to be noted is the Project Identification Number (P.I. No.) The project Program Identification Number is 332520.

This project also has a second P.I. No. (0000523) for the interstate bridge widening project. Not all projects will have multiple PIs. This plan set only covers P.I. No. 332520.

The project number for P.I. No. 332520 is STP-IM-022-1(26) and the project number for P.I. No. 0000523 is IM- 0000-001 (523). Questions in this text only refer to P.I. No. 332520 which is project number STP-IM-022-1(26).

Lastly, note that this project has does not have a Federal Route Number, only a State Route Number of 16.

PROJECT LOCATION SKETCH

In the upper left corner of the Cover Sheet is a Location Sketch, which shows the general geographical area of the project. This map shows the approximate limits of the project. An example is shown at the right in Figure 1-3.

![Image description](Figure 1-3. Location)

LAYOUT VIEW

In the center and under the title of the Cover Sheet is a LAYOUT VIEW. This view shows the beginning station and the ending station of the project.

Figure 1-4 above is a "Plan View" of the project. You will be exposed to a PLAN VIEW in another section of this manual. If you were flying over this project in an airplane and looking down, the PLAN VIEW is what you would see.

SCALE

Roadway and structure plans are drawn to scale in order that they might be presented on easy-to-use sheets.

Roadway plans are normally drawn with an engineer's scale while structure plans use both engineer's and architect's scales.

Chapter 1: Beginning to Read Plans

A civil engineer's scale has divisions of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 to the inch.

An architect's (or mechanical engineer's) scale expresses scale as fraction of an inch to one foot. Sample scales would be 1/4" = one foot, 3/8" = 1 foot, 1/8" = 1 foot, or similar.

The engineer's scale is one that expresses "scale" as 1 inch = 10 feet; 1 inch = 20 feet, 1 inch = 30 feet, 1 inch = 40 feet, 1 inch = 50 feet, 1 inch = 60 feet, or some multiple of these numbers. It is usually 1 foot long and may be triangular or flat.

![Image description](Figure 1-9. Civil engineer's scale (above top) and architect's scale (abovebottom).) The scales are divided into decimal parts of an inch such as 1/10th inch, 1/20th inch, etc.

The triangular, or six-scale scale, has scales with 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 divisions to the inch. In the next drawing, each division equals 1-foot - in the 1" = 10' scale, there are 10 divisions to the inch. Each division can be treated in multiples of 10 as well, for example, 1" = 100', 1" = 1000', etc.

![Image description](Scale representation with values from 0 to 3 and 10 and 20 indicators) ![Image description](Figure 1-10. Detail of the Engineer's Scale.) The scale on which the Cover Sheet was plotted is shown graphically above the Length of Project Box. The cover sheet for this plan set is 1"=2000'. Plan sheets, however, are plotted on various scales depending on the need for detail, etc., and are notated as such on the respective plan sheets. Turn to Sheet No. 60 and note the scale. A bar scale is shown and stated in feet.
