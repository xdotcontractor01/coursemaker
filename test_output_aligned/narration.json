    "narration_text": "Welcome to our overview of bridge superstructure components. As shown in the diagram, the superstructure includes critical elements such as bearing devices, beams, decks, and railings. It's vital for contractors to verify substructure elevations before starting construction. Notice how the beam layout aligns with anchor bolt holes. Ensure that bearing areas are level and flat, and correct any irregularities. Shear connectors should be welded to beams, with field welding inspected by the Office of Materials and Testing. Remember, beams must be pre-inspected and erected according to specifications, using bracing during erection. For elastomeric pads, a level surface is essential, and any bronze plates must be inspected; uninspected plates should be reported to the Inspection Services Branch."
